# Grammars

All grammars started as copies of a corresponding grammar in the antlr4/grammars-v4 repository.

## C
Intention: A subset of the C language, providing basic procedural syntax. (I most certainly do NOT want all the craft that C11 provides.)

Current state: Direct copy from grammars-v4

## Calc
A calculator grammar sporting scientific calculator functionality.

## IDL

## JSON

## Lisp
An ANTLR4 grammar for [lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)).  

## Pascal
Intent: A procedural subset of the Pascal programming language; definitely not looking to have the full Pascal syntax in here.

Current state: Direct copy from grammars-v4

## Tiny
An ANTLR4 grammar for [Tiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_programming_language) files.

# TinyBasic
An ANTLR4 grammar for [TinyBasic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC) files.

# TinyC Grammar
An ANTLR4 grammar for [TinyC](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~felipe/IFT2030-Automne2002/Complements/tinyc.c) files. The grammar and examples are copied directory from the comments at the top of the TinyC source code.
