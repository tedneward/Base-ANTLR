# Docker
Use `build.sh` to build the Docker image.

Use `run.sh` to run the Docker image.

Both should be run from the top-level project directory; e.g., `./docker/build.sh` and `./docker/run.sh`. Otherwise the relative directory paths get messed up, and I don't want to try and bulletproof the scripts to adjust for it.
